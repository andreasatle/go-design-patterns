# Factory Design Pattern
Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern and it is also one of the most commonly used pattern. This pattern provides a way to hide the creation logic of the instances being created.

The client only interacts with a factory struct and tells the kind of instances that needs to be created. The factory class interacts with the corresponding concrete structs and returns the correct instance back.
